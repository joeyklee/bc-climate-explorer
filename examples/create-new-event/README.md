# What's an event in the bc-climate-explorer
If something happens on the bc-climate-explorer page e. g. a button gets clicked or the zoom changes in the interactive map then an event gets fired. This event will take care that for example an function gets executed. This pattern is called [Pubsub pattern (Publish-subscribe pattern)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)
